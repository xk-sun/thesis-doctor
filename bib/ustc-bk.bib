   abstract = {The European XFEL is a 3.4 km long X-ray Free Electron Laser in the final construction and commissioning phase in Hamburg. It will produce 27000 bunches per second at 17.5 GeV. Early 2015 a first electron beam was produced in the RF-photo-injector and the commissioning of consecutive sections will follow during this and next year. The huge number and variety of devices for the accelerator, beam line, experiment, cryogenic and facility systems pose a challenging control task. Multiple systems, including industrial solutions, must be interfaced to each other. The large number of bunches requires a tight time synchronization (down to picoseconds) and high performance data acquisition systems. Fast feedbacks from front-ends, the DAQs and online analysis system with a seamless integration of controls are essential for the accelerator and the initially 6 experimental end stations. It turns out that the European XFEL will be the first installation exceeding 2500 FPGA components in the MicroTCA form factor and will run one of the largest PROFIBUS networks. Many subsystem prototypes are already successfully in operation. An overview and status of the XFEL control system will be given.},

The core of the system is the so-called Hardware Controller which is in charge of the control hardware management, the set up and communication with the EPICS network and the data storage. The reconfigurable nature of the controller is based on a single XML file, allowing any final user to easily modify and adjust the control system to any specific requirement. The selected Java development environment ensures a multiplatform operation and large versatility, even regarding the control hardware to be controlled. Specifically, this paper, focused on fast control based on a high performance FPGA, describes also an application approach for the ESS Bilbao's Beam Position Monitoring system. The implementation of the XML configuration file and the satisfactory performance outcome achieved are presented, as well as a general description of the Multipurpose Controller itself. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

The MPS collect interlocks and beam dump requests from various system (thermo/flow of magnets, front-end, vacuum system, and orbit excursion interlock), perform decision, transmit dump beam request to E-Gun or RF system. The PLC based system with embedded EPICS IOC was used as a slow MPS which can delivery less than 8 msec reaction time. The fast MPS was dependent on event based timing system to deliver response time less than 5 sec. Trigger signal for post-mortem will also be distributed by the fast MPS. To ensure alive of the system, several self-diagnostics mechanisms include heartbeat and transient capture were implemented and tested. The MPS architecture, installation, and validation test results were presented in this report.},

The main topic of the paper is the design of the communication controller (CC), which is central to the data distribution and its FPGA-based implementation. The CC design is unaware of the network topology so enables a number of options for the physical structure and further supports diverse routes so enabling operation to continue with single and multi-link faults.},

   abstract = {Controls and data acquisition in accelerators often involve some kind of computing platform (VME, PICMG 1.3, MTCA.4...) connected to Distributed I/O Tier electronics using a fieldbus or another kind of serial link. At CERN, we have started a project to rationalize this tier, providing a modular centrally-supported platform which allows equipment groups to focus on solving their particular problems while benefiting from a set of well-debugged building blocks. The paper describes the strategy, based on 3U Euro crates with a generic FPGA-based board featuring space for FMC mezzanines. Different mezzanines allow communication using different protocols. There are two variants of the electronics, to deploy in environments with and without radiation tolerance requirements. The plans we present are the result of extensive discussion at CERN among all stakehold-ers. We present them here with the aim of gathering further feedback and potential interest for inter-lab collaborations.},

@article{Knezic2017,
   abstract = {Ethernet Powerlink (EPL) is an industrial Ethernet networking solution commonly used as a communication network in distributed control and automation systems ranging from simple I/O to highly complex motion control applications. The PollResponse Chaining (PRC) mechanism is a new EPL standard feature aimed at increasing the network performance when nodes exchange small amount of data, especially if they are connected in line topology. In this paper, we present a theoretical model suitable for assessing the real-time performance of the EPL protocol operating in both the standard and PRC mode for two basic topologies commonly found in real installations, line, and star. Moreover, we carried out a series of experiments on prototype networks in order to acquire the relevant timing parameters of the EPL network components required for the development of an OMNeT++ simulation model, which can be further exploited to evaluate the EPL protocol in the case of more complex scenarios. Finally, we propose a modification of the original PRC solution to improve its flexibility while allowing the same (or even higher) performance level. The feasibility of the proposed approach was demonstrated on a real prototype, whereas a certain performance gain over the original PRC mechanism was proved through simulations conducted on a more complex network structure.},
